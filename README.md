## What is it?

It's channel-surfing for your mediacenter.  Never again will you have to actually pick what you want to watch.  
Use an electronic program guide (EPG) to view what's on or select a show to watch.  This script will let you create 
your own channels and, you know, watch them.  Doesn't actually sound useful when I have to write it in a readme.


## Features

- Automatic channel creation "Autotuning" based on your library, installed plugins and online sources.
- Optionally customize the channels you want with the in-app channel configuration tool.
- Utilize Kodi smartplaylist editor or the in-app advanced channel rules to create rich channel lineups.
- Use an EPG and view what was on, is on, and will be on.  Would you rather see something that will be on later? Select it and watch it now!
- Extended show information including a OnDemand menu.
- Missed the beginning of a show? use the "Start Over" feature.
- Want to pause a channel while you watch another?  And then come back to it and have it be paused still?  Sounds like a weird request to me, but if you want to do it you certainly can.  It's a feature!
- An idle-timer makes sure you aren't spinning a hard-drive needlessly all night.
- Accidental left the EPG open? or screen paused? No need to worry a handy clock screensaver displays when idle.
- No need to wonder what's on next, toward the end of a program the "Coming Up Next" will display information on the upcoming program.
- Multi-Action sleep timer, Turn the TV off? Shutdown Kodi? it's up to you.
- Discover the other features on your own (so that I don't have to list them all...I'm lazy).
- Emby, Plex, Serviio and UPNP Support.
- Intergrated USTVnow and HDHomeRun Support w/ Guidedata
- Support for customize skins and skin manager.
- Full Kodi integration including Context Menu and Artwork.
- Multiroom Video Mirroring and Channel sharing.


## Controls

There are only a few things you need to know in order to control everything. First of all, the ``Close`` \ ``Exit`` \ ``Backspace`` \ ``Previous`` button exits the script.  

You may also press the Previous Menu ``Escape`` button to do this (don't worry, it will prompt you to verify first).  

Scroll through channels using the arrow up and down keys, or alternatively by pressing Page up or Page down. 

You can also jump through the EPG using ``mouse scroll wheel`` or ``touch gestures``

Switch directly to a channel by inputting the ``channel number``, or navigate to it in the EPG.

To open the EPG, press the ``Select`` \ ``OK`` key or ``Enter``. 

Move around using the arrow keys. Start a program by pressing ''Select/OK''.  

Pressing Previous Menu ``Escape`` will close the EPG. Pressing ``Context Menu`` will reveal more options. 

Press ``I`` to display or hide the info window. 

When it is displayed, you can look at the next shows on this channel using ``arrow right``. 

Pressing the ``arrow left`` reveals the "Sidebar" menu.

Pressing the ``Context Menu`` will show the "MoreInfo" bar.
