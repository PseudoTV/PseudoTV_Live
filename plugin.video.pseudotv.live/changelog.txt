   In-order for multi-room to work, Kodi needs to be configured with a centralized database and all media must use shared paths.
   Start the pairing process by clicking "Bonjour Announcement" under multi-room settings.
   You'll have 15mins to start Kodi on another device, which for the first 60secs at startup will look for pairing.
   Once paired, you can enable the new server in multi-room settings "Select Servers".
   PseudoTV Live will configure IPTV Simple PVR backend to use the selected servers files.
