------------

# Settings:

## Playback Method: 

1. PVR Callback - This method keeps Kodi believing you are using a Live feed from the PVR backend. Pros| Kodi PVR UI and Widget updates. Near infinite channel playback. Cons| Slower channel content changes. (1-60secs. depending on your system). If "Overlay" is enabled in settings; and active during content change you will be met with a custom background. (Currently static).

2. Playlist - Standard Kodi playlist queue (not to be confused with a smart playlist). Pros| Channel content changes quickly. Cons| Kodi does not treat playback as PVR channel, Playlist queues are finite.

## Seek tolerance (Smart Seeking):

Adjusting seek tolerance (in seconds) adds a buffer at the beginning of media that is currently selected to play and which includes an offset for a "Pseudo" Live effect. The greater the number the more it ignores the time differential between "live" and "load" times.
ex. If after a show ends your next show which should start at the beginning starting a few seconds into the future; due to a lag in loading time. Raising the seek tolerance well remedy this... 0 disables tolerance.

## Seek Threshold(Smart Seeking):

Adjusting seek threshold(percentage). threshold to which the current content can be played back before dismissing for the next queue. Ex. The content you select to play maybe near the end instead of loading two seconds of credits; PseudoTV Live will tune the next show automatically. 100% disables threshold (content played till the end).

## Parse for Accurate Duration Meta:

1. "Prefer Kodi Library" - Duration meta collected from the values provided by your metadata provider. ie. TVDB, TMDB, etc... Pros: Faster background channel building, Cons: Usually inaccrate, rounded values.

2. "Prefer File Metadata" - Media files are parsed individually for real runtimes. Pros: Accurate EPG guide times, Cons: Slower background channel building. File extensions supported `.avi,.mp4,.m4v,.3gp,.3g2,.f4v,.mov,.mkv,.flv,.ts,.m2ts,.strm`

	`.strm` files require matching `.nfo` sharing the same name. ex. `foobar movie,the.strm` & `foobar movie,the.nfo` Supported nfo parameters `runtime,duration,durationinseconds`. *note `runtime,duration` in minutes.

	*see "Save Accurate Duration to Kodis Library"

## Save Accurate Duration to Kodis Library:

- In-order to reduce parsing times when using "Prefer File Metadata" PseudoTV Live can store the new accurate duration meta to the Kodi library, there are no downsides. If you notice performance penalties when enabled, disable it... There is a fallback 28 day cache to avoid unnecessary file parsing. 

## Recommended Services: (Temporarily unavailable)

Recommended Services are considered "third-party" and are not treated as "PseudoTV" channels. Channel configurations, channel numbering, onscreen overlays are all disabled. Imports are 1:1 m3u/xmltv imports with the exception of channel numbers which maybe altered as described below.

## Options:
    
- Centralized file location: Location to store PseudoTV Live M3U/XMLTV and other shared resources. ie. Playlists, Nodes and Channel Logos.
    
------------

# General Information:


## - Channel Logos:

Logo's are cached and may not be refreshed immediately....

Default Logo location - `/userdata/plugin.video.pseudotv.live/cache/logos`. *Location associated with Centralized File Location.

Filenames must match the channel name exactly as it appears in the guide. Supported formats `*.jpg,*.png,*.gif`

If no logo is found, PseudoTV Live will parse for a matching logo in the following folder order.

    `/addons/plugin.video.pseudotv.live/resources/images`, 

    `*resource.images.pseudotv.logos`, 

    ** [`resource.images.studios.white`, `resource.images.studios.coloured`], `resource.images.moviegenreicons.transparent`, `resource.images.musicgenreicons.text`

[Resource packs](https://github.com/PseudoTV/PseudoTV_Resources/blob/master/README.md) - Standard Kodi image resource packs. 

## - Channel Sharing (Multi-Room):

### Server:

For "Multi-Room", Select an instance of Kodi/PseudoTV Live that will act as your primary "server". *All instances of Kodi must be configured for sharing. ie. Shared/Mapped Drives and Central Database (mySQL). Only your "Server" instance of PseudoTV Live will build/update channels. 

	1 https://kodi.wiki/view/MySQL 

	1 https://kodi.wiki/view/Path_substitution 

### Client:

Enable under "Multi-Room", select between two options.

	1 Remote URL - Use a remote url hosted by your server instance which can be selected in settings. *http://localhost:50001/pseudotv.m3u **http://localhost:50001/pseudotv.xml ***http://localhost:50001/genres.xml

	1 Network Folder - Select a shared network path same as configure on the server instance.

## - Channel Ordering (Numbering):

### - Number Assignment:

For full control of channel numbering it is recommend users create "Custom" user-defined channels. Channels 1-999 are reserved to users, anything higher is reserved and auto assigned to "Autotuned" pre-defined channels.

Pre-defined channels yield no control over numbering; numbers are auto assign by type (ranging from channels 1000-9999), using lowest available number by type.

"Recommend Services" auto assigned by a multiplier based on the amount of imports staring at channel 11000, then appending the imports channel number. 

For example importing two M3Us/services. Import one will start at 11000, the other 21000. ex. If you are importing a m3u that contains channel 4.1, and 11. They will appear as 11004.1 and 11011. 

Each import is limited to 9999 (assuming each channel is an interger. Sub-Numbering, ie. floats ex. 4.1 extend the amount of possible imports) channels per import with a total of 9 total imports allowed.

- Channel Range:
-- `1-999` User-defined
-- `1000-9999` Pre-defined (Autotuned)
-- `10000-99999` Imports (Third-party m3u and recommend services)

### - EPG Ordering:

#### - IPTV Simple Settings:

"only number by order" must be disabled if you would like to respect the channel numbers assigned in PseudoTV Live.
*NOTE: PseudoTV Live automatically applies the optimal settings to IPTV Simple in-order to maximize the user experience.

#### - Kodi PVR & LiveTV Settings:

If you want the exact channel numbers from PseudoTV Live to reflect onscreen, you will have to enable "Use channel order from backend". While in settings "Synchronize channel groups with backend" should also be enabled.
*NOTE: changes will require users to clear data from the same PVR settings menu

## - Channel Manager:

### - Color Legend:
- In-use (White)       - Existing channel configuration.
- Unused (Dim-Grey)    - Available for configuration.
- Favorite (Yellow)    - User Favorites.
- Radio (Cyan)         - User-defined Radio/Music channel.
- Un-editable (Orange) - Pre-defined or Parental Locked channels are displayed as "un-editable" within the manager.
- Warnings (Red)       - Indicates either a new channel that hasn't populated or an existing channel without content.

## - Fillers:
"Auto" - Attempts to fill the gap between the nearest 15min time block with a mix of adverts and trailers depending on user configuration.
"Random Filler" - Add content that does not match channels name or subject genre at random in-order to fulfill users configuration. 

- Rating   - MPAA video before a movie.
- Bumpers  - Bumper video before tv content.
- Adverts  - Commercials after content.
    "iSpot" - Internet adverts injected randomly between channel content.
- Trailers - Trailers after context and shuffled with adverts when applicable. 
    "Kodi Trailers" - Local trailers curated by subject genre and later used in matching genre channels.
    "IMDB Trailers" - Internet trailers curated by subject genre and either used in matching genre channels.

### Custom Fillers:
- Root folders have a chance for random placement on any channel.
- Subfolders must match channel name or genre type exactly, not cap sensitive.
- See resources [README.md](https://github.com/PseudoTV/PseudoTV_Resources/raw/master/README.md)

# FYI & Known Issues:

- If you experience poor performance using PseudoTV Live; Try disabling "Accurate Duration" parsing. 
  It is recommend on low power devices like AndroidTV/AppleTV to outsource channel building to a "server" instance of Kodi running on a PC; then configure all other pair your remaining Kodi instances.

- If content is ignored/not added to the guide or episodes start/end before their assigned EPG time ie. guide times are off. Navigate to "Parse for Accurate Duration Meta" settings and select "Prefer File Metadata". 
  Media Meta sites like TMDB, TVDB usually contain rounded duration/runtime values which will yield inaccurate guide times. Parsing the file directly grabs the actual duration value. 
  If content is ignored, it is usually due to no duration/runtime information. Parsing the file resolves this problem. If however both your library and file contain no duration meta content will remain ignored.

- Blank EPG cells; Either Kodi EPG data is malformed; Enter Kodi settings "PVR & LiveTV", navigate to "Guide" and click "Clear data". or
  The xmltv file is outdated and PseudoTV Live will update in the background in time...

- Context Menu may be unavailable while viewing EPG. To enable go do Kodi "PVR & LiveTV" then "Guide" and changing the default select action to "show context menu".

- Some video sources (i.e. plugins, UPnP) do not support seeking, which could cause playback to fail or always start at the beginning. Try loading the content via Context Menu ("Play Programme","Play from here").

- All content must include duration details either embedded in the file or via Kodi Library.

- Settings are dim and inaccessible in settings. Some settings require content to operate (ex. Selecting TV Networks require your Kodi database have TV Content). There are also actions that can not simultaneously run while PseudoTV background tasks are performed (ie. If you wait for tasks to finish, settings will become selectable).

- Enable "Channel surfing" (Only available in PVR Playback mode). Navigate Kodi settings, find "PVR Live TV" settings and "Playback" then disabled "confirm channel switches by pressing "ok"".

- "One Click" channel playback... Navigate to Kodi "PVR & Live TV" settings and change "selection action".

- Channel Manager Colors, Dim = Unused, White = User-defined, Orange = Pre-defined, Red = Failed (Channel may not have content / appear in the guide and/or PseudoTV hasn't built the channel yet.)

- You can not skip ahead or time shift during linear playback... unless in "Playlist" playback.
    However, you can play any single show from the guide at any time or start playlist playback from any given position in the guide using the available context menu items.
    Play programme == Play single show from the start as "VOD" (Video On Demand).
    Play from here == Queue channel content from the selected starting position (Playlist Queue).

    ![Play Programme](https://i.imgur.com/ykLfzu6.png "Play Programme")
    ![Play From Here](https://i.imgur.com/ZSZzpmy.png "Play From Here")

- Channel surfing only works while in PVR CallbacK mode and during linear playback; VOD & Playlist playback exits the PVR UI and thus channel surfing if enabled.
  For uninterrupted channel surfing configure Kodi's PVR & LiveTV settings as followed: "confirm channel switches by pressing "ok"" set to disabled. 

- Content ordering defaults to 'random' for all content except TV which defaults to 'episode' ordering. 'Mixed" content ordering defaults to 'year' for Movies. This only applies to channels configured without sort/order methods or rules. Multi-Path channels will default to using a standard interleaving distribution. *see below for details.
 
    #### Default Interleaving Sequence:
    `#interleave multi-paths, while preserving sequence order`
    
    `#input  = [[1,2,3,4],[a,b,c,d],[A,B,C,D]]`
 
    `#output = [1, 'a', 'A', 2, 'b', 'B', 3, 'c', 'C', 4, 'd', 'D']`

- "Mixed" Content TV & Movie Smartplaylist are unsupported by Kodi and its given type was designed for "Music" media. PseudoTV Live can parse "Mixed" type playlist to allow mixed content channels. Create a "Mixed" smartplaylist type and select the `path, playlist or virtual folder` you'd like to use.

    #### How-To Create Mixed Smartplaylist:
    ![How-To Create Mixed Smartplaylist](https://i.imgur.com/MY7CO2p.mp4)
    
    1. Open Smartplaylist editor, Select "Mixed" Type. Enter playlist name and when prompted save the file.

	1. While in the "Mixed" smartplaylist navigate to playlist type select "TV", Enter a rule to select a "Path", "Virtualfolder" or "Playlist" with an inclusive operator of "is" or "contains".

	1. Navigate again to playlist type select "Movie" and repeat the steps above. Before leaving the editor switch playlist type back to "Mixed" and save.

- Adding "pvr://" as a Kodi video source can improve channel changing times on certain platforms by whitelisting the path for jsonrpc access. Follow the directions below and select "None" as your media type.

# Plugin Integration for Developers.
It is recommend developers disable pagination of content and turn off listitems onscreen UI render when `xbmcgui.Window(10000).getProperty("PseudoTVRunning") == 'True'`.

- "Recommend Channels" Integrate plugin paths to PseudoTV Live.

    In-order for a plugin to announce itself to PseudoTV Live; it must first run a "Beacon" service. Examples can be found below.
