[COLOR=cyan][B]Welcome to {addon_name}[/B][/COLOR]
__________________________


[B]Getting Started:[/B]

    Introduction
    ____________
    
        {addon_name} starts by scanning Kodi's library to populate the "AutoTune" list*. 
    When the library scan is complete, you'll have an option to "AutoTune" sample channels or open settings and configure your own using the "Channel Manager"**.

        Once channels are fully configured, {addon_name} will begin building... This process may take several minutes to complete; during this time your EPG may remain blank.
    Channels do not instantaneously appear on the EPG, There maybe factors that contribute to delays. If after building your EPG remains blank, simply restart Kodi to force channel detection.

    * "AutoTune" list - Predefined channels aggregated from your Kodi library; updated semi-regularly as you add media. You can force an Autotune list update using the utility menu found in miscellaneous settings.
       
    ** "Channel Manager" - Robust channel creation tool designed to let users create custom channels from any Kodi media source.


    PVR Configuration
    _________________

        {addon_name} can not reliably self configure itself due to recent Kodi PVR changes. Users are advised to navigate Kodi "Addon" menu, select "My Addons", "PVR Clients" and open {pvr_name} settings.
    If you do not see {addon_name} in {pvr_name} settings menu, exit settings. Open {addon_name} settings and select "{lang_30074}" found in miscellaneous settings. 
    Repeat the previous actions and verify {pvr_name} has a {addon_name} entry, check that it is configured as follows.
