<!--

Custom Providers:
 - Allows users to create a bespoke list of providers to map to.
 - For each provider name that matches a provider name below the given name, type,
   icon, country codes and lanuage codes will be used.
 - If no names match the addon will just use the supplied name and any other metadta supplied
   in the M3U for the provider.
 - The valid values for types are: unknown, addon, satellite, cable, aerial and iptv
 - Country codes should be ISO 3166 codes, comma separated (e.g 'GB,IE,FR,CA'),
   an empty string means this value is undefined.
 - Language codes should be RFC 5646 codes, comma separated (e.g. 'en_GB,fr_CA'),
   an empty string means this value is undefined.

If you have publicly available icons for providers and would like to make them available as default please
create an issue at https://github.com/kodi-pvr/pvr.iptvsimple/issues requesting their inclusion.

If you are creating your own Custom Providers file make a copy of this file in the same directory so it's
not overwritten and start from there.

NOTE: IF YOU MODIFY THIS FILE IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN NEXT TIME THE ADDON IS STARTED
